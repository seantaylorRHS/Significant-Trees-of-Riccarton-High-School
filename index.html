  <h1>The Significant Plantings of Riccarton High School</h1>
  <br>
  <p1>
    Riccarton High School has long been recognised for its spacious, park-like grounds. This was not always the case! When the school was first built in 1957, the land around the first four blocks (B, S and T blocks and the old admin block) was bare. Most of the school grounds lay over the shingle of an old riverbed where the soil was of poor quality. The landscaping of the grounds took place over a number of years as finance became available and the ground conditions were improved. Along the way, many trees and gardens have been planted to commemorate significant occasions, or in memory of staff or students.

    Early Trees

  <p1>
    The oldest trees that still survive on the Riccarton High School grounds are the native trees alongside the drive from Main South Road, which were planted in 1957 while the school was being constructed. The large trees outside Science and Technology blocks which face the main courtyard were planted in the winter of 1958, along with the distinctive cypress tree at the entrance to the Hall.
