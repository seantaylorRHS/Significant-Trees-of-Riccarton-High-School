    Commemorative Trees
  </h2>
  <p1>
    There is a <a href="http://easybigtrees.co.nz/product/ulmus-louis-van-houtte-golden-elm/">golden elm</a> planted near the main entrance to the school by our first principal, Alan Gainsford, on his retirement. There is no plaque to indicate this tree, but it is still thriving in the grassy area at the Vicki Street end of the car park. Another <a href="http://easybigtrees.co.nz/product/ulmus-louis-van-houtte-golden-elm/">golden elm</a> was planted near the assembly hall by our second principal, Terry Hitchings, when he retired, but this tree unfortunately later fell down. His plaque is now under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginkgo_biloba">gingko tree</a> in the courtyard between the assembly hall and admin block. An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulmus_minor_%27Atinia%27">English</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulmus_minor_%27Atinia_Variegata%27"> silver leaf</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elm">elm</a> tree was planted in the bark covered area between C, P and S blocks to mark the opening of the Peerswick room, but this has no plaque. A Silver Jubilee <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedar">cedar</a> was planted for the twenty fifth anniversary of the school, but this has not thrived. This tree was located in the garden behind the Art classrooms in B block, facing out to the school grounds, and the plaque is still there. The Golden Jubilee kauri tree was planted in the same garden to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the school opening.
