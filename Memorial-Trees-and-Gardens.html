    Memorial Trees and Gardens
  </h2>
  <p>
    The large courtyard in between Admin, B, S and T blocks was planted in honour of Terry Ludecke who was chair of the Board of Governors at the time of his death. He was a member of St Peter’s church, a scientist, a keen sportsman and father of three former students. His plaque is at the foot of a <a href="http://easybigtrees.co.nz/product/fraxinus-aurea-golden-ash/">golden ash tree</a> opposite the Sports Coordinator’s office. At the Hall end of G/H block is a memorial garden for Ewan Johnstone who died while he was the head of the Geography department. Besides being involved in many activities at school, he was a pilot and a Lieutenant Colonel in the Territorial Army. The courtyard between G/H block and S block was established as a memorial to Peter Richards, who was head of the Science faculty when he died. He specialised in Chemistry but had many interests including photography, magic and technology. His plaque was at the foot of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locust_tree">locust tree</a>, but it was moved when the Science block was extended. The courtyard area was landscaped and his plaque was moved on to a new garden. At this time a plaque was also added as a memorial to Stuart Squire, who was popular Physics teacher and parent of two former students. A rhododendron garden has been planted at the main entrance to the Science block with plaques in memory of Colin Moir and Ann Drake. They were two well loved Chemistry teachers who were both passionate about their subject and inspired many to go on to further studies. There are also trees that have been planted in memory of students who were killed in accidents on the road:
